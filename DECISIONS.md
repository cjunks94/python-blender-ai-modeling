## ADR-001: Frontend Architecture and CSS Strategy

**Date**: 2025-07-29
**Status**: Implemented
**Priority**: High

### Context

The application initially used inline CSS and inconsistent styling patterns, making maintenance difficult and causing UI inconsistencies. A scalable CSS architecture was needed to support future development.

### Decision

Implemented a comprehensive CSS architecture with the following principles:

#### 1. ðŸŽ¨ Comprehensive CSS Architecture
- **Extracted all inline CSS** to dedicated `app.css` stylesheet
- **Implemented BEM methodology** with consistent naming conventions:
  - `.block` for independent components
  - `.block__element` for parts of components
  - `.block--modifier` for variations of components
- **Created CSS custom properties** for theming and maintainability:
  ```css
  :root {
    --color-blender-orange: #f5792a;
    --gradient-purple: linear-gradient(135deg, #667eea 0%, #764ba2 100%);
    --transition-fast: 0.2s ease-in-out;
  }
  ```
- **Added purple gradient branding** throughout for AI features

#### Key Components Implemented:
- `.btn` with variants (`.btn--primary`, `.btn--secondary`, `.btn--ai`)
- `.modal` with `.modal__content`, `.modal__header` structure  
- `.card` with `.card__header`, `.card__body`, `.card__footer`
- `.collapsible` with `.collapsible__header`, `.collapsible__content`
- `.form-input`, `.form-label`, `.form-group` for consistent forms

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Dramatically improved maintainability
- Consistent visual design across the application
- Easy to extend with new components
- Clear separation of concerns
- Professional appearance with branded purple theme

**Negative:**
- Required updating JavaScript selectors to match new class names
- Initial time investment for refactoring

### Implementation Details

- **File**: `src/web/static/css/app.css` (711+ lines of organized CSS)
- **Methodology**: BEM (Block Element Modifier)
- **Browser Support**: Modern browsers with CSS custom properties
- **Build Process**: Direct CSS, no preprocessor required

### Decision

Implemented comprehensive accessibility standards throughout the application:

#### 2. â™¿ Accessibility Standards
- **Added ARIA labels** throughout all forms and interactive elements
- **Implemented semantic HTML** with proper structure:
  - `<fieldset>` and `<legend>` for form groupings
  - `<section>` elements with proper headings
  - `<main>`, `<header>`, `<nav>` for page structure
- **Added screen reader support** with `.sr-only` helper text for context
- **Ensured proper focus management** and keyboard navigation
- **ARIA attributes** for dynamic content:
  - `aria-expanded` for collapsible sections
  - `aria-controls` to link triggers with content
  - `aria-describedby` for help text associations

#### Example Implementation:
```html
<fieldset class="form-group">
  <legend class="form-label">Object Type</legend>
  <label class="object-option cursor-pointer">
    <input type="radio" name="object_type" value="cube" 
           aria-describedby="cube-description">
    <div class="object-option__content">...</div>
    <div id="cube-description" class="sr-only">Basic 3D cube primitive</div>
  </label>
</fieldset>
```

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Fully accessible to screen readers and assistive technologies
- Better SEO through semantic HTML
- Improved keyboard navigation
- Legal compliance (WCAG 2.1 AA standards)
- Better user experience for all users

**Negative:**
- Increased HTML complexity
- Additional testing required for accessibility

### Testing

- Screen reader compatibility verified
- Keyboard navigation tested throughout
- ARIA labels provide clear context for all interactive elements

## ADR-003: Component Architecture and Design System

**Date**: 2025-07-29
**Status**: Implemented
**Priority**: Medium

### Context

The UI lacked consistency in button sizes, colors, and component behavior. A systematic approach was needed to create a cohesive design system.

### Decision

Created a comprehensive component architecture and design system:

#### 3. ðŸ§© Component Architecture
- **Standardized button system** with semantic variants:
  - `.btn--primary` (Blender orange) for main actions
  - `.btn--secondary` (gray) for secondary actions  
  - `.btn--ai` (purple gradient) for AI features
  - `.btn--success`, `.btn--warning`, `.btn--danger` for status
  - `.btn--outline` for secondary/ghost buttons
- **Created consistent modal components**:
  - `.modal` with backdrop and centering
  - `.modal__content` for the actual modal container
  - `.modal__header` with title and close button
  - `.modal__close` for accessible close functionality
- **Implemented proper hero section** with purple gradient theme
- **Added comprehensive form styling** with proper input variants:
  - `.form-input` for text inputs and selects
  - `.form-input--range` for sliders
  - `.form-label` with size variants
  - `.form-group` for proper spacing

#### Button System Example:
```css
.btn {
  display: inline-flex;
  align-items: center;
  padding: 0.75rem 1.5rem;
  border-radius: 0.5rem;
  font-weight: 600;
  transition: var(--transition-fast);
}

.btn--ai {
  background: var(--gradient-purple);
  color: white;
}
```

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Consistent visual hierarchy
- Easy to maintain and extend
- Clear design patterns for developers
- Professional, branded appearance
- Reduced CSS duplication

**Negative:**
- Required refactoring existing components
- More CSS classes to manage

### Usage Guidelines

- Use `.btn--primary` for main actions (Generate, Create)
- Use `.btn--ai` for AI-powered features
- Use `.btn--outline` for secondary actions (Cancel)
- Always include appropriate ARIA labels
